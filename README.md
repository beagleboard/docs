# docs.beagleboard.io

![Build Status](https://git.beagleboard.org/docs/docs.beagleboard.io/badges/main/pipeline.svg)

This project seeks to document the design and usage of BeagleBoard.org boards.

Priority is given to the out-of-box Debian Linux software images, but additional well-maintained software projects supporting these boards are welcome to be documented here as well. 

This project seeks to provide a more official and easy to consume set of documenation than is available through wiki pages, but still encourages community contributions. Issues and pull requests will be reviewed for accuracy.

The project will have release versions and archive those specific versions for future reference. The stable release versions will be published at https://docs.beagleboard.org. The latest output is hosted at https://docs.beagleboard.io and source is maintained at https://git.beagleboard.org/docs/docs.beagleboard.io.
