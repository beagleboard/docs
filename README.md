# Support
<p>
BeagleBoard.org products and <a href="https://www.oshwa.org/definition/" class="external">open hardware</a> designs are supported via the on-line community resources. We
    are very confident in our community's ability to provide useful answers in a timely
    manner. If you don't get a productive response within 24 hours, please escalate
    issues to Jason Kridner (contact info available on the <a href="https://beagleboard.org/about">About Page</a>).
    In case it is needed, Jason will help  escalate issues to suppliers, manufacturers
    or others. Be sure to provide a link to your questions on the community forums as
    answers will be provided there.
