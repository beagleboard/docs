This is a collection of open-source books written to help Beagle developers.

`BeagleBone Cookbook <beaglebone-cookbook>`__ is a great introduction to programming
a BeagleBone using Linux from userspace, mostly using Python or JavaScript.

`PRU Cookbook <pru-cookbook>`__ provides numerous examples on using the incredible
ultra-low-latency microcontrollers inside the processors used on BeagleBone boards
that are a big part of what has made BeagleBone such a popular platform.
