Getting Started
################

We assume you have some experience with the Beagle and are here to learn about 
the PRU.  This chapter discusses what Beagles are out there, how to load the 
latest software image on your beagle, how to run the Cloud9 IDE and how to 
blink an LED.

If you already have your Beagle and know your way around it, you can find the
code (and the whole book) on the PRU Cookbook github site: 
https://github.com/MarkAYoder/PRUCookbook. 

Selecting a Beagle
====================

Problem
----------

Which Beagle should you use?

Solution
----------

http://beagleboard.org/boards lists the many Beagles from which to choose.  
Here we'll give examples for the venerable `BeagleBone Black <http://beagleboard.org/black>`_, 
the robotics `BeagleBone Blue <http://beagleboard.org/blue>`_, 
tiny `PockeBeagle <http://beagleboard.org/pocket>`_ and the powerful `AI <http://beagleboard.org/ai>`_.
All the examples should also run on the other Beagles too.

Discussion
------------

BeagleBone Black
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you aren't sure which Beagle to use, it's hard to go wrong with the
`BeagleBone Black <http://beagleboard.org/black>`_.  It's the most popular 
member of the open hardware Beagle family.

.. _start_black:

BeagleBone Blue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Blue <http://beagleboard.org/blue>`_ is a good choice if you are doing robotics.

.. _start_blue:

The Blue has everything the Black has except it has no Ethernet or HDMI.  
But it also has:

* Wireless: 802.11bgn, Bluetooth 4.1 and BLE
* Battery support: 2-cell LiPo with balancing, LED state-of-charge monitor
* Charger input: 9-18V
* Motor control: 8 6V servo out, 4 bidirectional DC motor out, 4 quadrature encoder in
* Sensors: 9 axis IMU (accels, gyros, magnetometer), barometer, thermometer
* User interface: 11 user programmable LEDs, 2 user programmable buttons

In addition you can mount the Blue on the 
https://www.renaissancerobotics.com/eduMIP.html[EduMIP kit] as shown in
:ref:`start_edumip` to get a balancing robot.

.. _start_edumip:

shows how to assemble the robot and control it from 
`LabVIEW <http://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html>`_.

PocketBeagle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `PocketBeagle <http://beagleboard.org/pocket>`_ is the smallest member of the 
Beagle family.  It is an ultra-tiny-yet-complete Beagle that is software 
compatible with the other Beagles.

.. _start_pocket:

PocketBeagle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: figures/PocketBeagle-size-compare-small.jpg

The Pocket is based on the same processor as the Black and Blue and has:

* 8 analog inputs
* 44 digital I/Os and 
* numerous digital interface peripherals

See http://beagleboard.org/pocket for more details.

BeagleBone AI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to do deep learning, try the  `BeagleBone AI <http://beagleboard.org/ai>`_.

.. _start_ai:

BeagleBone AI

* Zero-download out-of-box software experience with Debian GNU/Linux


Installing the Latest OS on Your Bone
======================================

Problem
---------

You want to find the lastest version of Debian that is available for your Bone.

Solution
---------

On your host computer open a browser and go to
http://beagleboard.org/latest-images.

.. TODO  Update links

This shows you two current choices of recent Debian images,
one for the BeagleBone AI 
(`AM5729 Debian 10.3 2020-04-06 8GB SD IoT TIDL <https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/am57xx-debian-10.3-iot-tidl-armhf-2020-04-06-6gb.img.xz>`_) and
one for all the other Beagles (
`AM3358 Debian 10.3 2020-04-06 4GB SD IoT <https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-10.3-iot-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz>`_).
Download the one for your Beagle.

Latest Debian images

It contains all the packages we'll need.

Flashing a Micro SD Card
=========================

Problem
---------

I've downloaded the image and need to flash my micro SD card.

Solution
---------

Get a micro SD card that has at least 4GB and preferibly 8GB.  

There are many ways to flash the card, but the best seems to be Etcher by
https://www.balena.io/.  Go to https://www.balena.io/etcher/ and download the version for your host 
computer.  Fire up Etcher, select the image you just downloaded (no need to 
uncompress it, Etcher does it for you), select the SD card and hit the *Flash* 
button and wait for it to finish.

.. _start_etcher:

Etcher
~~~~~~~~

Once the SD is flashed, insert it in the Beagle and power it up.

Cloud9 IDE
===========

Problem
------------

How do I manage and edit my files?

Solution
------------

The image you downloaded includes `Cloud9 <https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/>`_,
a web-based intergrated development environment (IDE) as shown in 
:ref:`start_c9`.

.. _start_c9:

Cloud9 IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: figures/c9.png
    :align: center
    :alt: The Cloud9 IDE

Just point the browswer on your host computer to http://192.168.7.2 
and start exploring.  If you want the files in your home directory to appear
in the tree structure click the settings gear and select *Show Home in Favorites* 
as shown in :ref:`start_c9_show_home`.

.. _start_c9_show_home:

Cloud9 Showing Home files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: figures/c9ShowHome.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Cloud9 showing home files


If you want to edit files beyond your home directory you can link to the root file system by:

.. code-block:: bash

    bone$ *cd*
    bone$ *ln -s / root*
    bone$ *cd root*
    bone$ *ls*
    bbb-uEnv.txt  boot  etc   ID.txt  lost+found  mnt           opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
    bin           dev   home  lib     media       nfs-uEnv.txt  proc  run   srv   tmp  var

Now you can reach all the files from Cloud9.

Getting Example Code
====================

Problem
---------

You are ready to start playing with the examples and need to find the code.

Solution
---------

You can find the code (and the whole book) on the PRU Cookbook github site: 
<https://github.com/MarkAYoder/PRUCookbook/tree/master/docs>. Just clone 
it on your Beagle and then look in the *docs* directory.  

.. code-block::bash

    bone$ *git clone https://github.com/MarkAYoder/PRUCookbook.git*
    bone$ *cd PRUCookbook/docs/*
    bone$ *ls -F*
    01case/     05blocks/  book.adoc  copyright.adoc  index.html  projects.adoc
    02start/    06io/      book.html  hack.sh*        Makefile    projects.html
    03details/  07more/    book.pdf   header.adoc     notes.adoc  style.adoc
    04debug/    08ai/      common/    index.adoc      notes.html  style.html


Each chapter has its own directory and within that directory is a **code** directory that has all of the code.

.. code-block::bash

    bone$ *cd 02start/code/*
    bone$ *ls*
    hello.pru0.c  hello.pru1_1.c  Makefile  setup.sh

Go and explore.

Blinking an LED
=================

Problem
---------

You want to make sure everything is set up by blinking an LED.

Solution
----------

The 'hello, world' of the embedded world is to flash an LED. :ref:`start_hello` 
is some code that blinks the ``USR3`` LED ten times using the PRU.

.. TODO The *'s and _'s in the code are messing with the formatting.

.. _start_hello:

hello.pru0.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:download:`hello.pru0.c <code/hello.pru0.c>`

Later chapters will go into details of how this code works, but if you want 
to run it right now do the following.

.. code-block:: bash

    bone$ *git clone https://github.com/MarkAYoder/PRUCookbook.git*
    bone$ *cd PRUCookbook/docs/02start/code*

.. tip::

    If the following doesn't work see 
    `Compiling with clpru and lnkpru <../03details/details.html#_compiling_with_clpru_and_lnkpru>`_
    for instillation instructions.

.. _start_running_code:

Running Code on the Black or Pocket

    PROC    = pru
    PRUN    = 0

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    bone$ *make TARGET=hello.pru1_1*
    /var/lib/cloud9/common/Makefile:28: MODEL=BeagleBoard.org_BeagleBone_AI,TARGET=hello.pru1_1
    -    Stopping PRU 1_1
    CC	hello.pru1_1.c
    "/var/lib/cloud9/common/prugpio.h", line 4: warning #1181-D: #warning directive: "Found AI"
    LD	/tmp/cloud9-examples/hello.pru1_1.o
    -	copying firmware file /tmp/cloud9-examples/hello.pru1_1.out to /lib/firmware/am57xx-pru1_1-fw
    write_init_pins.sh
    writing "none" to "/sys/class/leds/beaglebone:green:usr3/trigger"
    -    Starting PRU 1_1
    MODEL   = BeagleBoard.org_BeagleBone_AI
    PROC    = pru
    PRUN    = 1_1
    PRU_DIR = /dev/remoteproc/pruss1-core1
    rm /tmp/cloud9-examples/hello.pru1_1.o

Look quickly and you will see the ``USR3`` LED blinking.  

Later sections give more details on how all this works.
