Code
----

.. code:: python

   while : true {
       if : digital_read(P1_29) {
           digital_write(P1_31, false);
       }
       else {
           digital_write(P1_31, true);
       }
   }

-  Following code works on PocketBeagle, to use on other boards, please
   change the pins accordingly.

Explaination
------------

This code runs a never ending loop, since it is ``while : true``. Inside
``while`` if header pin P1_29 is HIGH, then header pin P1_31 is set to
HIGH, waits for 1000ms, then sets header pin P1_31 to LOW, then again it
waits for 1000ms. This loop runs endlessly as long as header pin P1_29
is HIGH, so we get a Blinking output if one connects a LED to output
pin.
