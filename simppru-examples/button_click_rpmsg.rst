.. code:: python

   init_message_channel();

   while : true {
       if : digital_read(P1_29) {
           send_message(1);
       }
       else {
           send_message(0);
       }
       delay(100);
   }

   change the pins accordingly.

Explaination
------------

``init_message_channel`` is needed to setup communication channel
between ARM<->PRU. It only needs to be called once, before using RPMSG
functions.

``while : true`` loop runs endlessly, inside this, we check for value of
header pin P1_29, if it reads HIGH, 1 is sent to the ARM core using
``send_message`` and if it is LOW, 0 is sent to ARM core using
``send_message``. Then PRU waits for 100ms, and repeats the steps again
and again.
