|Interacto    |A cape making BeagleBone interactive with a triple-axis accelerometer, 
gyroscope and magnetometer plus a 640 x 480/30 fps camera. 
All sensors are digital and communicate via IÂ²C to the BeagleBone. 
The camera frames are captured using the PRU-ICSS. The sensors on this cape 
give hobbyists and students a starting point to easily build robots and flying drones.

|Replicape: 3D Printer    |Replicape is a high end 3D-printer electronics package in the form of a Cape that can be placed on a BeagleBone Black. It has five high power stepper motors with cool running MosFets and it has been designed to fit in small spaces without active cooling. For a Replicape Daemon that processes G-code, see the Redeem Project
