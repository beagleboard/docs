Board Changes
-----------------

Rev C
***********

* Changed the eMMC from 2GB to 4GB.

2GB devices are getting harder to get as they are being phased out. This
required us to move to 4GB. We now have two sources for the device. This
will however, require an increase in the price of the board.

Rev B
***********

* Changed the processor to the AM3358BZCZ100.

Rev A6A
*************

* Added connection from 32KHz OSC_GND to system ground and changed C106 to 1uF.
* Changes C25 to 2.2uF. This resolved an issue we were seeing in a few boards where the board would not boot in 1 in 20 tries.
* Change required PCB revision to B6.

Rev A6
************

* In random instances there could be a glitch in the SYS_RESETn signal from the processor where the SYS_RESETn signal was taken high for a momentary amount of time before it was supposed to. To prevent this, the signal was ORed with the PORZn (Power On reset).
* Noise issues were observed in other design where the clock oscillator was getting hit due to a suspected issue in ground bounce. A zero ohm resistor was added to connect the OSC_GND to the system ground.

There are no new features added as a result of these changes.

Rev A5C
*************

We were seeing some fallout in production test where we were seeing some
jitter on the HDMI display test. It started showing up on out second
production run. R46, R47, R48 were changed to 0 ohm from 33 ohm. R45 was
taken from 330 ohm to 22 ohm.

We do not know of any boards that were shipped with this issue as this
issue was caught in production test. No impact on features or
functionality resulted from this change.

Rev A5B
*************

There is no operational difference between the Rev A5A and the Rev A5B.
There were two changes made to the A5B version.

* Due to complaints about the brightness of the LEDs keeping people awake at night, the LEDs were dimmed. Resistors were changed from 820 ohms to 4.75K ohms.
* The PCB revision was updated to incorporate the hand mod that was being done on the board during manufacturing. The resistor was incorporated into the next revision of the PCB.

The highest supported resolution is now listed as 1920x1080@24Hz. This
was not a result of any hardware changes but only updated software. The
A5A version also supports this resolution.

Rev A5A
*************

This is the initial production release of the board. We will be tracking
changes from this point forward.
