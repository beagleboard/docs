`BeagleBone <beaglebone>`__ is a family of ARM-based, Linux-capable boards intended to be
bare-bones, with a balance of features to enable rapid prototyping and provide a solid
reference for building end products.

`PocketBeagle <pocketbeagle>`__ boards are ultra-tiny ARM-based, Linux-capable boards intended to be
very low cost, with minimal features suitable for beginners and attractive to professionals
looking for a more minimal starting point.

`BeagleBone and PocketBeagle Capes <capes>`__ are add-on boards for BeagleBone and PocketBeagle boards.

`BeagleConnect <beagleconnect>`__ boards are ARM microcontroller-based, Zephyr-capable boards meant
to act as ultra low cost smart peripherals to their Linux-capable counterparts, with connectivity
options that enable almost endless sensing and actuation expansion.

`BeagleBoard <beagleboard>`__ is a family of ARM-based, Linux-capable boards where this project
started.
