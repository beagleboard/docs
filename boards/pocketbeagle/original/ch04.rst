PocketBeagle Overview
=============================

PocketBeagle is built around Octavo Systems' OSD335x-SM
System-In-Package that integrates a high-performance Texas Instruments
AM3358 processor, 512MB of DDR3, power management, nonvolatile serial
memory and over 100 passive components into a single package. This
integration saves board space by eliminating several packages that would
otherwise need to be placed on the board, but more notably simplifies
our board design so we can focus on the user experience.

The compact PocketBeagle design also offers access through the expansion
headers to many of the interfaces and allows for the use of add-on
boards called PocketCapes and Click Boards from MikroElektronika, to add
many different combinations of features. A user may also develop their
own board or add their own circuitry.

OSD3358-512M-BSM System in Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Octavo Systems OSD3358-512M-BSM System-In-Package (SiP) is part of a
family of products that are building blocks designed to allow easy and
cost-effective implementation of systems based in Texas Instruments
powerful Sitara AM335x line of processors. The OSD335x-SM integrates the
AM335x along with the TI TPS65217C PMIC, the TI TL5209 LDO, up to 1 GB
of DDR3 Memory, a 4 KB EEPROM for non-volatile configuration storage and
resistors, capacitors and inductors into a single 21mm x 21mm
design-in-ready package.

With this level of integration, the OSD335x-SM family of SiPs allows
designers to focus on the key aspects of their system without spending
time on the complicated high-speed design of the processor/DDR3
interface or the PMIC power distribution. It reduces size and complexity
of design.
