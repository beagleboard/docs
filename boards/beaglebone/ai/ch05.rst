AM572x Sitara™ Processor
**************************

The Texas Instruments AM572x Sitara™ processor family of SOC devices
brings high processing performance through the maximum flexibility of a
fully integrated mixed processor solution. The devices also combine
programmable video processing with a highly integrated peripheral set
ideal for AI applications. The AM5729 used on BeagleBone® AI is the
super-set device of the family.

Programmability is provided by dual-core ARM® Cortex®-A15 RISC CPUs with
Arm® Neon™ extension, and two TI C66x VLIW floating-point DSP core, and
Vision AccelerationPac (with 4x EVEs). The Arm allows developers to keep
control functions separate from other algorithms programmed on the DSPs
and coprocessors, thus reducing the complexity of the system software.

board, for a total of 1 GB. They will each operate at a clock frequency
of up to 533 MHz yielding an effective rate of 1066Mb/s on the DDR3L bus
allowing for 4GB/s of DDR3L memory bandwidth.

16GB Embedded MMC

through connectors or expansion header pin accessibility. See section 7
for more information on expansion header pinouts. There are a few
functions that are not accessible which are: (TBD)

TODO: This text needs to go somewhere.
