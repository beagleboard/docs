Introduction
##############

Built on the proven BeagleBoard.org速 open source Linux approach,
BeagleBone速 AI fills the gap between small SBCs and more powerful
industrial computers. Based on the Texas Instruments AM5729, developers
have access to the powerful SoC with the ease of BeagleBone速 Black
header and mechanical compatibility. BeagleBone速 AI makes it easy to
explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in everyday life
via TI C66x digital-signal-processor (DSP) cores and
embedded-vision-engine (EVE) cores supported through an optimized TIDL
machine learning OpenCL API with pre-installed tools. Focused on
everyday automation in industrial, commercial and home applications.
