BeagleConnect™ Story
*********************

There are many stories behind BeagleConnect™, mine is just one of them. It 
begins with my mom teaching me about computers. She told me I could anything I 
wanted with ours, as long as I didn’t open the case. This was the 
late-70s/early-80s, so all she needed to do was put her `floppy disk <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk>`_ 
away and there wasn’t risk of me damaging the family photo album or her 
ability to do her work the next day. I listened and learned from her the basics
of programming, but it wasn’t long before I wanted to take the computer apart.

Initially exploring `Getting Started in Electronics <http://www.forrestmims.org/>`_ 
satisfied my itch for quite a while. Eventually, I got a Commodore 64 and began
connecting voice synthesizer ICs to it. My interest in computers and 
electronics flourished into an electrical engineering degree and a long career 
in the semiconductor industry.

Over this time, I’ve become more and more alarmed with the progress of 
technology. Now, to be clear, I love technology. I love innovation and 
invention. It is just that some things have evolved in a sort of 
tunnel-vision, without bringing everyone along.

But, what about keyboard users? As graphical user interfaces and mice took over
computers, they rapidly became almost unusable by my mom. She typed well, but 
the dexterity to move a mouse aluded her. To satisfy the need to interact with 
locations on the screen, she adopted using a joystick and her productivity came
to a crawl. How is it that such assumptions could be made impacting all 
computer users without any thoughtful provisions for what already worked?
