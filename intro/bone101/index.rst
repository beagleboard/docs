   This page is under construction. Most of the information here is drastically out of date.

I don't want to completely lose the useful documentation we had at:

* https://beagleboard.github.io/bone101/Support/bone101/

Most of the useful information has moved to :ref:`bone-cook-book-home` , but this has been
the place I've most brainstormed free-form to make articles introducing people to BeagleBone.
For now, it can serve as a place to put some introductory information that is meant to be
from a bit of a different approach.
