Getting support
***************

BeagleBoard.org products and `open
hardware <https://www.oshwa.org/definition/>`__ designs are supported
via the on-line community resources. We are very confident in our
community’s ability to provide useful answers in a timely manner. If you
don’t get a productive response within 24 hours, please escalate issues
to Jason Kridner (contact info available on the `About
Page <https://beagleboard.org/about>`__). In case it is needed, Jason
will help escalate issues to suppliers, manufacturers or others. Be sure
to provide a link to your questions on the `community
forums <https://forum.beagleboard.org>`__ as answers will be provided
there.

Be sure to ask `smart questions <http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>`__
that provide the following:

*  What am I trying to accomplish?
*  What did find when researching how to accomplish it?
*  What are the detailed results of what I tried?
*  How did these results differ from what I expected?
*  What would I consider to be a success?

.. note::
   Remember that community developers are volunteering their expertise. If you
   want paid support, there are options for that. Respect developers time and
   expertise and they might be happy to share with you.
