2.  As a standalone development platform in a desktop PC configuration with a Display Port Monitor, power supply, keyboard, and mouse 

.. _whats-in-the-box:

Whatâ€™s In the Box
---------------------------

In the box you will find three main items as shown in :ref:`bbai-64-pacakage`.

* BeagleBone AI-64.
* Instruction card.

Get yourself a USB-A to USB-C and you have a setup for the tethered scenario and creates an out of box experience where the board can be used immediately with no other equipment needed.

.. _main-connection-scenarios:

Main Connection Scenarios
-------------------------------

This section will describe how to connect the board for use. This section is basically a slightly more detailed description of the Quick Start Guide that came in the box. There is also a Quick Start Guide document on the board that should also be referred to. The intent here is that someone looking to purchase the board will be able to read this section and get a good idea as to what the initial set up will be like.

The board can be configured in several different ways, but we will discuss the two most common scenarios as described in the Quick Start Guide card that comes in the box.

* Tethered to a PC via the USB cable 
  
  * ``Board is accessed as a storage drive and``
  * ``a virtual Ethernet connection.``
  
* Standalone desktop 
  
  * ``Display``
  * ``Keyboard and mouse``
  * ``External 5V > 3A power supply``

Each of these configurations is discussed in general terms in the following sections.

.. _tethered-to-a-pc:

Tethered To A PC
-------------------------

In this configuration, the board is powered by the PC via the provided USB cable --no other cables are required. The board is accessed either as a USB storage drive or via the browser on the PC. You need to use either Firefox or Chrome on the PC, Internet Explorer will not work properly. :ref:`tethered-figure` shows this configuration.

.. _tethered-figure:

.. figure:: images/ch03/usb-tethering.jpg
   :width: 400px
   :align: center 
   :alt: Tethered Configuration

   Fig: Tethered Configuration

At least 5V @ 3A is required to power the board, In most cases the PC may not be able to supply sufficient power for the board. You should always use an external 5V > 3A DC power supply connected to the barrel jack.

.. _connect-the-cable-to-the-board:

Connect the Cable to the Board
*************************************

1. Connect the type C USB cable to the board as shown in :ref:`usb-c-connect-figure`. The connector is on the top side of the board near barrel jack.

.. _accessing-the-board-as-a-storage-drive:

Accessing the Board as a Storage Drive
***********************************************

The board will appear around a USB Storage drive on your PC after thekernel has booted, which will take a round 10 seconds. The kernel on the board needs to boot before the port gets enumerated. Once the board appears as a storage drive, do the following:

1.  Open the USB Drive folder.
2.  Click on the file named **start.htm**
3.  The file will be opened by your browser on the PC and you should get a display showing the Quick Start Guide.
4.  Your board is now operational! Follow the instructions on your PC screen.

.. _standalone-wdisplay-and-keyboardmouse:

Standalone w/Display and Keyboard/Mouse
-----------------------------------------------

In this configuration, the board works more like a PC, totally free from any connection to a PC as shown in :ref:`desktop-config-figure`. It allows you to create your code to make the board do whatever you need it to do. It will however require certain common PC accessories. These accessories and instructions are described in the following section.

Ethernet cable and M.2 WiFi + Bluetooth card are optional. They can be used if network access required.

.. _required-accessories:

Required Accessories
***************************

In order to use the board in this configuration, you will need the following accessories:

* 5V > 3A power supply.
* Display Port or HDMI monitor.
* miniDP-DP or active miniDP-HDMI cable (or a recommended **miniDP-DP or active miniDP-HDMI adapter** https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089GF8M87 has been tested and worked beautifully).
* USB wired/wireless keyboard and mouse.
* powered USB HUB (OPTIONAL). The board has only two USB Type-A host ports, so you may need to use a powered USB Hub if you wish to add additional USB devices, such as a USB WiFi adapter.
* M.2 Bluetooth & WiFi module (OPTIONAL). For wireless connections, a USB WiFi adapter or a recommended M.2 WiFi module can provide wireless networking.

   :alt: Connect miniDP to DP or active miniDP to HDMI Cable to the Board

   Fig: Connect miniDP to DP or active miniDP to HDMI Cable to the Board

The connector is fairly robust, but we suggest that you not use the cable as a leash for your Beagle. Take proper care not to put too much stress on the connector or cable.

7. Booting the Board

As soon as the power is applied to the board, it will start the booting up process. When the board starts to boot the LEDs will come on. It will take a few seconds for the status LEDs to come on, so be patient. The LEDs will be flashing in an erratic manner as it boots the Linux kernel.

.. _LEDs-figure,BeagleBone AI-64 LEDs figure:

.. figure:: images/ch03/leds.jpg
   :width: 400px
   :align: center 
   :alt: BeagleBone AI-64 LEDs

   Fig: BeagleBone AI-64 LEDs

While the four user LEDS can be over written and used as desired, they do have specific meanings in the image that is shipped with the board once the Linux kernel has booted.

* **USR0** is the heartbeat indicator from the Linux kernel.
* **USR1** turns on when the microSD card is being accessed
* **USR2** is an activity indicator. It turns on when the kernel is not in the idle loop.
* **USR3** turns on when the onboard eMMC is being accessed.
* **USR4** is an activity indicator for WiFi.

8. A Booted System
   
   a. The board will have a mouse pointer appear on the screen as it enters the Linux boot step. You may have to move the physical mouse to get the mouse pointer to appear. The system can come up in the suspend mode with the monitor in a sleep mode.
   b. After a minute or two a login screen will appear. You do not have to do anything at this point.
   c. After a minute or two the desktop will appear. It should be similar to the one shown in :ref:`figure-16`. HOWEVER, it will change from one release to the next, so do not expect your system to look exactly like the one in the figure, but it will be very similar.
   d. And at this point you are ready to go! :ref:`figure-16` shows the desktop after booting.
