PocketBone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon the creation of the first, 27mm-by-27mm, Octavo Systems OSD3358
SIP, Jason did a hack two-layer board in EAGLE called “PocketBone” to
drop the Beagle name as this was a totally unofficial effort not geared
at being a BeagleBoard.org Foundation project. The board never worked
because the 32kHz and 24MHz crystals were backwards and Michael Welling
decided to pick it up and redo the design in KiCad as a four-layer
board. Jason paid for some prototypes and this resulted in the first
successful “PocketBone”, a fully-open-source 1-GHz Linux computer in a
fitting into a mini-mint tin.

Rev A1
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Rev A1 of PocketBeagle was a prototype not released to production. A
few lines were wrong to be able to control mikroBUS Click add-on board
reset lines and they were adjusted.

Rev A2
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Rev A2 of PocketBeagle was released to production and
