Introduction
=============

In this chapter, you will learn how to sense the physical world with BeagleBone Black. 
Various types of electronic sensors, such as cameras and microphones, can be connected 
to the Bone using one or more interfaces provided by the standard USB 2.0 host port, 
as shown in :ref:`sensor host port <sensors_host_port>`.

.. note::
   All the examples in the book assume you have cloned the Cookbook 
   repository on www.github.com. Go here :ref:`basic repo <basics_repo>` for instructions.

The two 46-pin cape headers (called +P8+ and +P9+) along the long edges of the 
board (:ref:`sensors P8 & P9 <sensors_P8P9_fig>`) provide connections for 
cape add-on boards, digital and analog sensors, and more.

The simplest kind of sensor provides a single digital status, such as off or on, 
and can be handled by an *input mode* of one of the Bone's 65 general-purpose input/output 
(GPIO) pins. More complex sensors can be connected by using one of the Bone's seven 
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) inputs or several I^2^C buses. 

:ref:`display <displays>` discusses some of the *output mode* usages of the GPIO pins.

All these examples assume that you know how to edit a file (:ref:`basic vsc <basics_vsc>`) and run 
it, either within the Visual Studio Code (VSC) integrated development environment (IDE) or from 
the command line (:ref:`shell tips <tips_shell>`).

Input and Run a Python or JavaScript Application for Talking to Sensors
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem
*********

You have your sensors all wired up and your Bone booted up, and you need to know how to enter and run your code.

Solution
*********

You are just a few simple steps from running any of the recipes in this book.

- Plug your Bone into a host computer via the USB cable (:ref:`basic out of the box<basics_out_of_the_box>`).
- Start Visual Studio Code (:ref:`basic vsc <basics_vsc>`).
- In the +bash+ tab (as shown in :ref:`sensors vsc bash <sensors_vsc_bash>`), run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ cd

  bone$ cd BoneCookbook/docs/02sensors/code

   VSC bash tab

Here, we issued the *change directory* (+cd+) command without specifying a target directory. 
By default, it takes you to your home directory. Notice that the prompt has changed to reflect the change. 

.. note:: 
  If you log in as +debian+, your home is */home/debian*. If you were to create a new user 
  called *newuser*, that user's home would be */home/newuser*. By default, all non-root 
  (non-superuser) users have their home directories in */home*.

.. note::
   All the examples in the book assume you have cloned the 
   Cookbook repository on www.github.com. Go here 
   :ref:`basic repo <basics_repo>` for instructions.

- Double-click the *pushbutton.py* file to open it.
- Press ^S (Ctrl-S) to save the file. (You can also go to the File menu in VSC and select Save to save the file, but Ctrl-S is easier.) Even easier, VSC can be configured to autosave every so many seconds.
- In the +bash+ tab, enter the following commands:

.. code-block::

  root@beaglebone:~/boneSensors# ./pushbutton.js
  data= 0
  data= 0
  data= 1
  data= 1
  ^C

This process will work for any script in this book.

.. _sensors_pushbutton:

Reading the Status of a Pushbutton or Magnetic Switch (Passive On/Off Sensor)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem
********

You want to read a pushbutton, a magnetic switch, or other sensor that is electrically open or closed.

Solution
*********

Connect the switch to a GPIO pin and read from the proper place in */sys/class/gpio*.

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires (see :ref:`app proto <app_proto>`)
* Pushbutton switch (see :ref:`app misc <app_misc>`)
* Magnetic reed switch (optional, see :ref:`<app misc app_misc>`)

You can wire up either a pushbutton, a magnetic reed switch, 
or both on the Bone, as shown in :ref:`figure below <js_pushbutton_fig>`.

.. _js_pushbutton_fig:

.. figure:: figures/pushbutton_bb.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Diagram for wiring a pushbutton and magnetic reed switch input
   
   Bone with pushbutton

The code in :ref:`js pushbutton code<js_pushbutton_code>` reads GPIO port *P9_42*, which is attached to the pushbutton. 

.. _py_pushbutton_code:

Monitoring a pushbutton (pushbutton.py)

.. code-block:: python

  include::code/pushbutton.py


.. _js_pushbutton_code:

Monitoring a pushbutton (pushbutton.js)

.. code-block:: javascript

  include::code/pushbutton.js

Put this code in a file called *pushbutton.js* following the steps in 
:ref:`sensor getting started <sensors_getting_started>`. 
In the VSC *bash* tab, run it by using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ ./pushbutton.js
  data = 0
  data = 0
  data = 1
  data = 1
  ^C

The command runs it. Try pushing the button. The code reads the pin and prints its current value.

You will have to press ^C (Ctrl-C) to stop the code.

If you want to use the magnetic reed switch wired as shown in :ref:`javascript pushbutton <js_pushbutton_fig>`, change +P9_42+ to +P9_26+ which is gpio +14+.

Mapping Header Numbers to gpio Numbers
---------------------------------------

Problem
********

You have a sensor attached to the P8 or P9 header and need to know which gpio pin it's using.

Solution
**********

The +gpioinfo+ command displays information about all the P8 and P9 header pins.  To see the info for just one pin, use +grep+.

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ gpioinfo | grep -e chip -e P9.42
  gpiochip0 - 32 lines:
	  line   7: "P8_42A [ecappwm0]" "P9_42" input active-high [used]
  gpiochip1 - 32 lines:
  gpiochip2 - 32 lines:
  gpiochip3 - 32 lines:

This shows P9_42  is on  chip 0 and pin 7.  To find the gpio number multiply 
the chip number by 32 and add it to the pin number.  This gives 0*32+7=7.  

For P9_26 you get:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ gpioinfo | grep -e chip -e P9.26
  gpiochip0 - 32 lines:
	  line  14: "P9_26 [uart1_rxd]" "P9_26" input active-high [used]
  gpiochip1 - 32 lines:
  gpiochip2 - 32 lines:
  gpiochip3 - 32 lines:

0*32+14=14, so the P9_26 pin is gpio 14.

Reading a Position, Light, or Force Sensor (Variable Resistance Sensor)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem
*********

You have a variable resistor, force-sensitive resistor, flex sensor, or any of a 
number of other sensors that output their value as a variable resistance, 
and you want to read their value with the Bone.

Solution
*********

Use the Bone's analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and a resistor 
divider circuit to detect the resistance in the sensor.

The Bone has seven built-in analog inputs that can easily read a 
resistive value. :ref:`cape header analog sensors <sensors_cape_headers_analog>` shows them 
on the lower part of the +P9+ header.

.. _sensors_cape_headers_analog:

.. figure:: figures/cape-headers-analog.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Seven analog inputs on the +P9+ header
   
   Seven analog inputs on P9 header

To make this recipe, you will need:

- Breadboard and jumper wires (see :ref:`app proto <app_proto>`)
- 10 k&#8486; trimpot (see :ref:`app resistor <app_resistor>`) or
- Flex resistor (optional, see :ref:`app resistor <app_resistor>`)
- 22 k&#8486; resistor (see :ref:`app resistor<app_resistor>`)

A variable resistor with three terminals

:ref:`sensor analogIn<sensors_analogIn_fig>` shows a simple variable resistor (trimpot) 
wired to the Bone. One end terminal is wired to the ADC 1.8 V power supply on pin *P9_32*, 
and the other end terminal is attached to the ADC ground (*P9_34*). The middle terminal 
is wired to one of the seven analog-in ports (*P9_36*).

:ref:`sensor analogIn code <sensors_analogIn_code>` shows the BoneScript code used to read the variable resistor.  
Add the code to a file called _analogIn.js_ and run it; then change the resistor and run it again. The voltage read will change.

  include::code/analogIn.js[]

.. note::
  The code in :ref:`sensor analogIn code<sensors_analogIn_code>` 
  outputs a value between 0 and 4096.

A variable resistor with two terminals

Some resistive sensors have only two terminals, such as the flex sensor in 
:ref:`sensor flex resistor<sensors_flexResistor_fig>`
The resistance between its two terminals changes when it is flexed.
In this case, we need to add a fixed resistor in series with the flex sensor. 
:ref:`sensor flex resistor <sensors_flexResistor_fig>` 
shows how to wire in a 22 k&#8486; resistor to give a voltage to measure
across the flex sensor.

The code in :ref:`py analogIn code <py_analogIn_code>` and

Reading a Distance Sensor (Analog or Variable Voltage Sensor)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Problem
********

You want to measure distance with a `LV-MaxSonar-EZ1 Sonar Range Finder <http://bit.ly/1Mt5Elr>`_, 
which outputs a voltage in proportion to the distance.

Solution
*********

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires (see :ref:`app proto <app_proto>`)
* LV-MaxSonar-EZ1 Sonar Range Finder (see :ref:`app musc <app_misc>`)

All you have to do is wire the EZ1 to one of the Bone's *analog-in* pins, 
as shown in `this figure<sensors_ultrasonic_fig>`. The device outputs ~6.4 mV/in when powered from 3.3 V.

.. _WARNING: 
   Make sure not to apply more than 1.8 V to the Bone's *analog-in* 
   pins, or you will likely damage them. In practice, this circuit should follow that rule.

Problem
**********

You want to use a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Range Sensor with BeagleBone Black.

Solution
**********
The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Range Sensor (shown in `hc sr04 sensor image <sensors_hc_sr04_image_fig>`) 
works by sending a trigger pulse to the *Trigger* input and then measuring the 
pulse width on the *Echo* output. The width of the pulse tells you the distance.

* HC-SR04 Ultrsonic Range Sensor (see :ref:`app misc <app_misc>`)

Wire the sensor as shown in :ref:`hc sr04 sensor<sensors_hc-sr04_fig>`. 
Note that the HC-SR04 is a 5 V device, so the *banded* wire (running from 
*P9_7* on the Bone to VCC on the range finder) attaches the 
HC-SR04 to the Bone's 5 V power supply.

Accurately Reading the Position of a Motor or Dial
----------------------------------------------------

Problem
**********

You have a motor or dial and want to detect rotation using a rotary encoder.

Solution
**********

Use a rotary encoder (also called a *quadrature encoder*) connected to one of 
the Bone's eQEP ports, as shown in :ref:`digital rotary encoder figure<digital_rotaryEncoder_fig>`.

  | eQEP0       | P9.27 and P9.42 OR P1_33 and P2_34 |
  +-------------+------------------------------------+
  |eQEP         | P9.33 and P9.35                    |
  +-------------+------------------------------------+
  |eQEP2        | P8.11 and P8.12 OR P2_24 and P2_33 |
  +-------------+------------------------------------+

On the AI it's:

.. table::

  +-------------+------------------------------------+
  |eQEP1        | P8.33 and P8.35                    |
  +-------------+------------------------------------+
  |eQEP2        | P8.11 and P8.12 or P9.19 and P9.41 |
  +-------------+------------------------------------+
  |eQEP3        | P8.24 and P8.25 or P9.27 and P9.42 |
  +-------------+------------------------------------+

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires (see :ref:`app proto <app_proto>`)
* Rotary encoder (see :ref:`app misc <app_misc>`)

We are using a quadrature rotary encoder, which has two switches inside 
that open and close in such a manner that you can tell which way the shaft 
is turning. In this particular encoder, the two switches have a common lead, 
which is wired to ground. It also has a pushbutton switch wired to the other 
side of the device, which we aren't using. 

Wire the encoder to +P8_11+ and +P8_12+, as shown in 
:ref:`digital rotary encoder <digital_rotaryEncoder_fig>`.

BeagleBone Black has built-in hardware for reading up to three encoders.  
Here, we'll use the *eQEP2* encoder via the Linux +count+ subsystem.


Then run the following commands:
.. code-block:: bash

   bone$ config-pin P8_11 qep
   bone$ config-pin P8_12 qep
   bone$ show-pins | grep qep
   P8.12        12 fast rx  up  4 qep 2 in A    ocp/P8_12_pinmux (pinmux_P8_12_qep_pin)
   P8.11        13 fast rx  up  4 qep 2 in B    ocp/P8_11_pinmux (pinmux_P8_11_qep_pin)

This will enable *eQEP2* on pins +P8_11+ and *P8_12*. 
The *2* after the +qep+ returned by *show-pins* shows it's *eQEP2*.  

Finally, add the code in :ref:`digital rotary encoder<digital_rotaryEncoder_js>` 
to a file named *rotaryEncoder.js* and run it.

.. _digital_rotaryEncoder_py:

Reading a rotary encoder (rotaryEncoder.py)

  include::code/rotaryEncoder.py

.. _digital_rotaryEncoder_js:

Reading a rotary encoder (rotaryEncoder.js)

.. code-block::javascript

   include::code/rotaryEncoder.js

Try rotating the encoder clockwise and counter-clockwise. You'll see an output like this:

.. code-block::bash

   data = 32
   data = 40
   data = 44
   data = 48
   data = 39
   data = 22
   data = 0
   data = 999989
   data = 999973
   data = 999972
   ^C


The values you get for +data+ will depend on which way you are 
turning the device and how quickly. You will need to press ^C (Ctrl-C) to end.

Acquiring Data by Using a Smart Sensor over a Serial Connection
-----------------------------------------------------------------

// TODO

Problem
**********

You want to connect a smart sensor that uses a built-in microcontroller to stream data, 
such as a global positioning system (GPS), to the Bone and read the data from it.

Solution
**********

The Bone has several serial ports (UARTs) that you can use to read data from an external 
microcontroller included in smart sensors, such as a GPS. Just wire one up, and you'll 
soon be gathering useful data, such as your own location.

Here's what you'll need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires (see :ref:`app proto <app_proto>`)
* GPS receiver (see :ref:`app musc <app_misc>`)

Wire your GPS, as shown in :ref:`digital GPS<digital_GPS_fig>`.

The GPS will produce raw National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) 
data that's easy for a computer to read, but not for a human. 
There are many utilities to help convert such sensor data into a 
human-readable form. For this GPS, run the following command to load a NMEA parser:

.. code-block:: bash

   bone$ npm install -g nmea

Running the code in :ref:`digital GPD code <digital_GPS_code>` 
will print the current location every time the GPS outputs it.

Measuring a Temperature
---------------------------

Problem
**********

You want to measure a temperature using a digital temperature sensor.

Solution
**********

The TMP101 sensor is a common digital temperature 
sensor that uses a standard I^2^C-based serial protocol.

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires (see :ref:`app proto <app_proto>`)
* Two 4.7 k&#8486; resistors (see :ref:`app resistor <app_resistor>`)
* TMP101 temperature sensor (see :ref:`app ic<app_ic>`)

Wire the TMP101, as shown in :ref:`i2c temprature sensor<sensors_i2cTemp_fig>`.

   :align: center
   :alt: Wiring an I^2^C TMP101 temperature sensor

   Wiring an I^2^C TMP101 temperature sensor

There are two I^2^C buses brought out to the headers. 
:ref:`sensor cap headers i2c <sensors_cape_headers_i2c>` 
shows that you have wired your device to I^2^C bus +2+.

.. _sensors_cape_headers_i2c:

.. figure:: figures/cape-headers-i2c.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Table of I^2^C outputs

   Table of I^2^C outputs


Once the I^2^C  device is wired up, you can use a couple handy I^2^C 
tools to test the device. Because these are Linux command-line tools, 
you have to use +2+ as the bus number. +i2cdetect+, shown in `javascript I2C tools <js_i2cTools>`, 
shows which I^2^C  devices are on the bus. The +-r+ flag indicates which bus to use. 
Our TMP101 is appearing at address *0x498. You can use the +i2cget+ command to read 
the value. It returns the temperature in hexidecimal and degrees C. 
In this example, 0x18 = 24{deg}C, which is 75.2{deg}F. (Hmmm, the office is a bit warm today.) 
Try warming up the TMP101 with your finger and running *i2cget* again.

Reading the temperature via the kernel driver

Assuming the TMP101 is at address 0x48:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ echo tmp101 0x49 > new_device


This tells the kernel you have a TMP101 sensor at address 0x49. Check the log to be sure.

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ dmesg -H | tail -3
  [ +13.571823] i2c i2c-2: new_device: Instantiated device tmp101 at 0x49

  [  +0.009976] lm75 2-0049: hwmon0: sensor 'tmp101'

Yes, it's there, now see what happened.

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ ls
  2-0049  delete_device  device  i2c-dev  name  
  new_device  of_node  power  subsystem  uevent


Notice a new directory has appeared. It's for i2c bus 2, address 0x49. Look into it.

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ cd 2-0048/hwmon/hwmon0
  bone$ ls -F
  device@  name  power/  subsystem@  temp1_input  temp1_max  
  temp1_max_hyst  uevent  update_interval
  bone$ cat temp1_input
  24250

There is the temperature in milli-degrees C.

Other i2c devices are supported by the kernel.
You can try the Linux Kernel Driver Database, 
https://cateee.net/lkddb/ to see them.

Once the driver is in place, you can read it via code.
:ref:`i2c temprature python code <py_i2cTemp_code>` 
shows how to read the TMP101 from BoneScript.

.. _py_i2cTemp_code:

Reading an I^2^C  device (i2cTemp.py)

.. code-block:: python

  include::code/i2cTemp.py[]


.. _js_i2cTemp_code:

.Reading an I^2^C  device (i2cTemp.js)

.. code-block:: javascript

   include::code/i2cTemp.js[]

Run the code by using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ ./i2cTemp.js
  data (C) = 25.625
  data (C) = 27.312
  data (C) = 28.187
  data (C) = 28.375
  ^C


Notice using the  kernel interface gets you more digits of accuracy.

Reading i2c device directly
*******************************

The TMP102 sensor can be read directly with i2c commands rather than using the kernel driver.  First you need to install the i2c module.

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ pip install smbus


.. _js_i2ctmp101_code:

Reading an I^2^C  device (i2cTemp.py)
.. code-block:: python

  include::code/i2ctmp101.py[]

This gets only 8 bits for the temperature.  See the TMP101 datasheet for details on how  to get up to 12 bits.

Reading Temperature via a Dallas 1-Wire Device
----------------------------------------------------

Problem
**********

You want to measure a temperature using a Dallas Semiconductor DS18B20 temperature sensor.

Solution
**********

I need to double-check how we provide attribution for recipes, but we'll need to have 
something more than "From" followed by a link. For now, we should at least do 
something like what I've changed it to. --BS

--may A bigger question is, when do we need attribution?  
I pull bits and pieces from everywhere and try to keep good records of sources.

The DS18B20 is an interesting temperature sensor that uses Dallas 
Semiconductor's 1-wire interface. The data communication requires only 
one wire! (However, you still need wires from ground and 3.3 V.) 
You can wire it to any GPIO port.

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires (see :ref:`app proto <app_proto>`)
* 4.7 k&#8486; resistor (see :ref:`app resistor <app_resistor>`)
* DS18B20 1-wire temperature sensor (see :ref:`app ic<app_ic>`)

Wire up as shown in :ref:`1 wire sensor <sensors_1-wire_fig>`.

.. _sensors_1-wire_fig:

.. note:: This solution, written by Elias Bakken (@AgentBrum), originally appeared on`Hipstercircuits http://bit.ly/1FaRbbK`_.

.. figure:: figures/onewire_bb.png

   :alt: 1-wire

   Wiring a Dallas 1-Wire temperature sensor 

Edit the file +/boot/uEnt.txt+. 
Go to about line 19 and edit as shown:

.. code-block:: bash

  17 ###
  18 ###Additional custom capes
  19 uboot_overlay_addr4=BB-W1-P9.12-00A0.dtbo
  20 #uboot_overlay_addr5=<file5>.dtbo

Be sure to remove the +#+ at the beginning of the line.

Reboot the bone:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ reboot


Now run the following command to discover the serial number on your device:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/
  28-00000114ef1b  28-00000128197d  w1_bus_master1


I have two devices wired in parallel on the same P9_12 input. 
This shows the serial numbers for all the devices. 

Finally, add the code in 
:ref:`onewire sensor code <sensors_onewire__code>` in to a 
file named *w1.py*, edit the path assigned to +w1+ so 
that the path points to your device, and then run it.

.. _py_onewire__code:

Reading a temperature with a DS18B20 (w1.py)

.. code-block:: python

  include::code/w1.py[]

.. _sensors_onewire__code:

Reading a temperature with a DS18B20 (w1.js)

.. code-block:: javascript

  include::code/w1.js[]


.. code-block:: bash

   bone$ ./w1.js
   temp (C) = 28.625
   temp (C) = 29.625
   temp (C) = 30.5
   temp (C) = 31.0
   ^C

**********

Each temperature sensor has a unique serial number, so you can have several all sharing the same data line.

Playing and Recording Audio
------------------------------

.. TODO:: Remove?

Problem
**********

BeagleBone doesn't have audio built in, but you want to play and record files.

Solution
**********

One approach is to buy an audio cape (:ref:`app capes <app_capes>`), but another, possibly cheaper approach is to buy a USB audio adapter, 
such as the one shown in :ref:`usb audio dongle<usb_audio_dongle>`. Some adapters that I've tested are provided in :ref:`app musc <app_misc>`.

.. _usb_audio_dongle:

Drivers for the `Advanced Linux Sound Architecture http://bit.ly/1MrAJUR`_ (ALSA) 
are already installed on the Bone. You can list the recording and playing devices on 
your Bone by using +aplay+ and +arecord+, as shown in :ref:`alsa sensors <sensors_alsa>`. BeagleBone Black 
has audio-out on the HDMI interface. It's listed as *card 0* in 
:ref:`also sensor <sensors_alsa>`. *card 1* is my USB audio adapter's audio out.

.. _sensors_alsa:

Listing the ALSA audio output and input devices on the Bone

  bone$ aplay -l

In the *aplay* output shown in :ref:`alsa sensor <sensors_alsa>`, you can see the 
USB adapter's audio out. By default, the Bone will send audio to the HDMI. You 
can change that default by creating a file in your home directory called 
*~/.asoundrc* and adding the code in :ref:`asoundrc <sensors_asoundrc>` to it.

.. _sensors_asoundrc:

Change the default audio out by putting this in ~/.asoundrc (audio.asoundrc)

.. code-block:: javascript

  include::code/audio.asoundrc


You can easily play _.wav_ files with +aplay+:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ aplay test.wav


You can play other files in other formats by installing +mplayer+:

.. code-block:: bash

  bone$ sudo apt update
  bone$ sudo apt install mplayer
  bone$ mplayer test.mp3

Adding the simple USB audio adapter opens up a world of audio I/O on the Bone.
