Getting started
---------------

The starting experience for all Beagles has been made to be as
consistent as is possible. For any of the Beagle Linux-based open
hardware computers, visit our `getting started guide <getting-started>`__.

hardware <https://www.oshwa.org/definition/>`__ designs are supported
via the on-line community resources. We are very confident in our
community’s ability to provide useful answers in a timely manner. If you
don’t get a productive response within 24 hours, please escalate issues
to Jason Kridner (contact info available on the `About
Page <https://beagleboard.org/about>`__). In case it is needed, Jason
will help escalate issues to suppliers, manufacturers or others. Be sure
to provide a link to your questions on the `community
